Human Intelligence (HUMINT) is a type of intelligence gathering that involves the collection and analysis of information from human sources. It involves the use of interpersonal and other forms of communication, observation and other means to gather information about people, organizations and events, in order to gain insights and intelligence about them. HUMINT is often used in military, intelligence, and law enforcement contexts, where it can provide valuable information about individuals, groups, and organizations that may pose a threat.
