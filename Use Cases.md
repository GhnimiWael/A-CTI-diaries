A CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) use case is a scenario that demonstrates how an organization can leverage CTI to address a specific security challenge or achieve a specific security goal.

For example, a common CTI use case is Threat Detection and Prevention. In this scenario, an organization leverages CTI to identify and prevent cyber threats before they can cause harm. This might involve using CTI to monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential attack vectors, and then using that information to implement preventative measures, such as updating firewalls, patching systems, or blocking malicious IP addresses.

Another CTI use case is Incident Response. In this scenario, an organization leverages CTI to respond quickly and effectively to a cyber incident. This might involve using CTI to gather information about the nature and extent of the incident, identifying the root cause, and determining the best course of action to mitigate the damage and prevent future incidents.

## Consideration
Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has several use cases, including:
- Threat Detection and Prevention: CTI helps organizations detect and prevent potential cyber threats by providing real-time information about new and emerging threats
- Vulnerability Assessment: CTI helps organizations assess their vulnerabilities to cyber threats and take necessary steps to secure their systems.
- Incident Response: CTI provides valuable information during the incident response process, including details about the threat, the extent of the damage, and recommendations for remediation.
- Compliance: CTI helps organizations meet regulatory requirements by providing the necessary data for compliance reporting.
- Risk Management: CTI provides organizations with a comprehensive view of their cyber risk landscape, enabling them to make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies.
- Competitive Intelligence: CTI helps organizations stay ahead of the competition by providing insights into the cyber threat landscape and emerging trends.
- Strategic Planning: CTI helps organizations make informed decisions about their security strategy by providing a comprehensive view of the cyber threat landscape.
