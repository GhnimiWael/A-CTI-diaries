A CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) use case is a scenario that demonstrates how an organization can leverage CTI to address a specific security challenge or achieve a specific security goal.

For example, a common CTI use case is Threat Detection and Prevention. In this scenario, an organization leverages CTI to identify and prevent cyber threats before they can cause harm. This might involve using CTI to monitor for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and potential attack vectors, and then using that information to implement preventative measures, such as updating firewalls, patching systems, or blocking malicious IP addresses.

Another CTI use case is Incident Response. In this scenario, an organization leverages CTI to respond quickly and effectively to a cyber incident. This might involve using CTI to gather information about the nature and extent of the incident, identifying the root cause, and determining the best course of action to mitigate the damage and prevent future incidents.
