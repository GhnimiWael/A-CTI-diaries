Qakbot, also known as Qbot, is a type of malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from infected computers. Qakbot is a Trojan virus, which means it is designed to hide its presence on an infected computer and operate silently in the background.

Qakbot typically spreads through spam email messages that contain a malicious attachment or link. Once the attachment or link is opened, Qakbot downloads and installs itself on the infected computer. It can also spread through network shares and by exploiting vulnerabilities in software installed on the computer.

Once Qakbot infects a computer, it can perform a variety of malicious actions. It can steal login credentials for online banking and other financial websites, record keystrokes to capture sensitive information such as credit card numbers and passwords, and download additional malware onto the infected computer.

Qakbot can also spread to other computers on the same network, allowing it to infect entire organizations. Qakbot is a persistent threat and can be difficult to remove once it has infected a computer or network. It is important to use up-to-date antivirus software and to regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities that Qakbot can exploit.
