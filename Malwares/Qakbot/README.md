## What is Qakbot ?

Qakbot, also known as Qbot, is a type of malware that is designed to steal sensitive information from infected computers. Qakbot is a Trojan virus, which means it is designed to hide its presence on an infected computer and operate silently in the background.

Qakbot typically spreads through spam email messages that contain a malicious attachment or link. Once the attachment or link is opened, Qakbot downloads and installs itself on the infected computer. It can also spread through network shares and by exploiting vulnerabilities in software installed on the computer.

Once Qakbot infects a computer, it can perform a variety of malicious actions. It can steal login credentials for online banking and other financial websites, record keystrokes to capture sensitive information such as credit card numbers and passwords, and download additional malware onto the infected computer.

Qakbot can also spread to other computers on the same network, allowing it to infect entire organizations. Qakbot is a persistent threat and can be difficult to remove once it has infected a computer or network. It is important to use up-to-date antivirus software and to regularly update software to patch vulnerabilities that Qakbot can exploit.

## IOCs

In the context of cybersecurity, IOC stands for "Indicator of Compromise". An IOC is a piece of evidence or artifact that suggests a computer system or network has been breached or compromised by an attacker.

Examples of IOCs include:
- Malicious IP addresses or domains that are associated with command-and-control (C2) servers used by malware to communicate with attackers.
- Malware signatures or hashes that are associated with known malware strains or variants.
- Anomalous network traffic or patterns of behavior, such as unusual data exfiltration or system login attempts.
- Suspicious files, such as executables or scripts, that are found on a system and have not been authorized by the organization.

By identifying IOCs, security teams can investigate and respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively. IOCs can be used to detect ongoing attacks, contain their impact, and prevent similar attacks from occurring in the future. Security professionals can collect and analyze IOCs from a variety of sources, including threat intelligence feeds, security tools, and logs from network and endpoint devices.
