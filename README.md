CTI stands for Cyber Threat Intelligence. It is information about current and potential cyber threats that is collected, analyzed, and disseminated to organizations in order to help them protect themselves from cyber attacks. Cyber threat intelligence can include information about specific threats, trends and patterns in the cyber threat landscape, and analysis and insights about the motivations, capabilities, and tactics of cyber adversaries. It is used by organizations to inform their cybersecurity strategies, prioritize their defenses, and respond to and mitigate cyber attacks.
